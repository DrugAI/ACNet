{'SMILES1':}


## Reproduce

The baseline experiments of ACNet are conducted by *self-made* training package.
To reproduce the results in the manuscript, this package and the experimental scripts are provided in this repository.
However, the usage of this package will not be introduced.
We only guarantee that the experimental scripts can work, other functions of the training package is not our point and will not be guaranteed.

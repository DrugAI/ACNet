### Project Description
The Activity Cliffs (ACs), which are generally defined as pairs of structurally similar molecules that are active against the same bio-target but have large difference in the binding potency, are of great interest to the community of drug discovery.
However, the AC prediction task, i.e. to predict whether a pair of similar molecules exhibit AC relationship, have not been fully explored yet.
This work introduces ACNet, a large-scale benchmark for Activity Cliff prediction tasks.
ACNet curates over 400K Matched Molecular Pairs (MMPs) against 190 targets, including over 20K MMP-cliffs and 380K non-AC MMPs, and provides five subsets for model development and evaluation.
The performance of 15 baseline molecular property prediction models adopted as molecular representation encoders for the AC prediction task are evaluated in the experiments.
The traditional FingerPrint-based method shows superiority over other complex deep learning models on these tasks.
And the imbalanced, low-data and out-of-distribution features of the ACNet benchmark make it challenging for the existing molecular property prediction models to cope with.
Our work is the first contribution of large-scale benchmark for the AC prediction task, with the hope to stimulate the study of AC prediction models and prompt further breakthrough in AI-aided drug discovery.
